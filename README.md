# business-object-libs
a generic representation of common object libs -giving back to community
this is based on ideas and donations of ocean2706 
-a generic abstraction of objects representation 

## What is wrong with uml and similar modeling -
This is a tool for programer geeks and crazy peoples that feel how the industry have done things wrong
A programmer feel better to talk in his own programming language. It is not his own goal to learn another and another language any time
So, instead forcing a programmer to learn a new way of defining interfaces, there will be tools to integrate "any" language, with just a little help to interoperate, by convention.

So, if we will have a java programmer that feel easy to write something like
'class Address {
  
}'
another user will be ready to use it in C# for example, or javascript by using a simple convention for referencing the existing code.
Also there will be ready to use objects like those established - microformats.org, 

Finaly, code generators will help you to read all definition, make links between all codes and generate coresponding xml code, or output entire libs in a language of your choice.

We believe that we can focus at this time on:
-php
-js
-c#
-java
-xml
-idl/wsdl




Focus your developement not on language, but to problem solving...
